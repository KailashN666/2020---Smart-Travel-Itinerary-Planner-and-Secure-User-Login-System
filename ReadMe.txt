This Delphi-coded project is designed for a travel agency and features an intelligent user login page. It enables users to create potential holiday itineraries based on the agency's offerings and provides quotes. If users forget their passwords, the program can email them a password reset. It uses SSL and SSH sockets to integrate its own email account for secure communication. Upon successful verification through security questions chosen during account creation, the program retrieves the user account details and emails the password.
